# Custom Vector Class
The python code library for initiating the vector class was provided as a part of the course. Ihave tried to come up with my C++ class definition to perform the same task. 

Suggested improvements to this code: 
1. While creating the array object I wanted to pass the vector array in real-time through command prompt. Code can be modified to do that workflow. 
2. Within the driver code section; instaead of creating an array and passing those to the constructor function, we could directly define the array objects to be passed on to the constructor. This will require further modification to accommodate the flow of work.
